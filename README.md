ReflectiveNAS is a file backup utility that keeps track of changes made to files within it and synchronizes those changes across multiple servers, ensuring that files are protected against hardware failure, natural disasters, etc and that past revisions of files and folders can be restored to any given date. ReflectiveNAS is designed to operate effectively on slow or unstable internet connections. The backed up files are mounted as a FUSE file system and can be combined with other file systems, FUSE applications (e.g. SSHFS) or services (e.g. SSH) to add features such as compression, encryption, remote access, etc. The ReflectiveNAS server runs on Linux and Windows (via Cygwin) and clients can be anything capable of remotely accessing files on the server through your application of choice.
